# All-Pharmacies-App
This app allows users to search for medicines across all pharmacies in their area within a single platform. It offers several useful features. When users search for a medicine, they can view available options from different pharmacies, compare prices, and check quantities. The app is also designed to be used by doctors and pharmacists. A doctor can write a prescription directly to the app, which the pharmacist can then use to dispense the medication.
